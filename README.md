> In order to execute the project, you need the Docker Desktop running.

> In the Visual Studio, set the docker-compose as the Start Up project, and hit Ctrl+F5.

> Or via CLI, in the project folder, you can use "docker-compose up --build".

> In case you don't have the Docker Desktop, you can use an existing SQL Server instance, by adjusting the connection string in the web project.
